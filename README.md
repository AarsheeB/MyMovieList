MyMovieList - is a movie and show cataloging web application where the users can use a list-like system to track and score movies and shows. It can also be used as a discussion forum and a movie/show search database. 
Below are some of the features that we plan to implement (they have not been prioritized yet)- 
Users can add movies/shows to their list and mark them as completed/currently watching/plan to watch
Users can add scores to the movies/shows and add a small review
Users can search for movies and shows based on genre and score
 Users can see all reviews of the movies and shows that they search for
New user profiles can be created 
Users can search for other users based on their username and share their lists, discussions, reviews and comments
The application will provide average scores to movies and shows based on scores
