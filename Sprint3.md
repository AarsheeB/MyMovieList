# Accomplishments

## Backend
### Storing and Retrieving Images from Database
* There is a continuation from Sprint 2. We are storing and retrieving images to and from our sqlite database
* The first step here is to store or upload our image files onto a server using golang
* Then the second step is to store the path of the file in our database
* We are utilising the TempFile API that has been introduced in Go version 1.11

### User Activities
* The functionalities that we are implementing for the user are login, register and delete a user

### Filter Based Search from our Database
* We are searching based on two parameters in this sprint
* The first paramater is the MovieName
* The second parameter is the MovieID
* We are also checking the condition if the movie name or id is not present and displaying messages respectively
