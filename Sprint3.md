# Accomplishments

## Backend
* There is a continuation from Sprint 2. We are storing and retrieving images to and from our sqlite database
* The first step here is to store or upload our image files onto a server using golang
* Then the second step is to store the path of the file in our database
* We are utilising the TempFile API that has been introduced in Go version 1.11
