* The endpoint is http://localhost:3000/logout

## User and Movie Mapping
After creating the users and movies, the next step is to map the user to their respective movie. We created a movies_status table that maintains the unique user ID, the corresponding unique movie ID and the status of that movie for the user (completed, watching, plan to watch, etc). The two IDs act as foreign keys and link the movies_status table to the user table as well as the movie table. 

### POST - setMovieStatus
* This service adds the user id and movie id as well as the current status of the movie for the user to the database. 
* The POST endpoint is http://localhost:3000/setMovieStatus
* The request body for this endpoint is as follows - 
```
{
        "userid": "2",
        "movieid": "5",
        "status": "Completed"
}
```
### Get - getMovieStatus
* This service retrieves all the movies and the status for the user that is provided as a part of the request.
* The header key is "userid" and the value is the ID of the user for which the movies have to be fetched
* The GET endpoint is http://localhost:3000/getMovieStatus
* The response is as follows - 

```
